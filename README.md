# Neural_Network_hyperparameter_optimization
Choosing optimum model hyperparameters 

* The file ```Basic MNIST Feed Forward NN (MLP).ipynb``` shows a two layer Feed Forward (FF) Neural Network (NN).

| Dataset        | Accuracy           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| MNIST | 98.02%      |

| Hyperparameter        | Technique used           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Weight initializer      | Xavier Uniform |
| Activation  | Relu      |
| Optimizer | RMSprop      |
| Regularization | None      |
| Loss function | kullback_leibler_divergence      |

Maybe put loss curves and model architecture here
